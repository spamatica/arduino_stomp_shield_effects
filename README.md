Effects for the Arduino Stomp shield
http://www.openmusiclabs.com/projects/stomp-shield/

This repository does not contain much of use yet.
It's a sharing ground for Arduino stomp shield effectsÂ¸ if you make an effect or adaptation for the stomp-shield and would like to share it, do let me know and I will add your work.

This far it contains a few effects which was created in my efforts
to create an octave down effect and a chorus adapted from PedalShield

* stomp_triangular_trigg - produces a mellow fuzz that may actually be of some use

* stomp_triangular_octavedown1-2 - produces wierd noises, doesn't really work :)

* stomp_triangular_octavedown3 - does produce octave down for 'well behaving input', it's easy to get it to produce massive amount of videogame style noise though. Can possibly be of some creative use =)

* stomp_chorus1 - really nice chorus effect adapted from PedalShield source


To install these effects clone this repository and copy the directories to your Arduino sketchbook directory. Or clone directly to the sketchbook if you feel that works for you.
