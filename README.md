Effects for the Arduino Stomp shield
http://www.openmusiclabs.com/projects/stomp-shield/

This repository does not contain much of use yet.
It's a sharing ground for Arduino stomp shield effects

This far it contains two effects which was created in my efforts
to create an octave down effect.

* stomp_triangular_trigg - produces a mellow fuzz that may actually be of some use

* stomp_triangular_octave - produces wierd noises, doesn't really work :)

To install these effects clone this repository and copy the directories to your Arduino sketchbook directory. Or clone directly to the sketchbook if you feel that works for you.
